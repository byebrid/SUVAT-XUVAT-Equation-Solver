# SUVAT-XUVAT-Equation-Solver
Python code where user can input three known variables and receive the other two unknown variables (for equations of motion with constant acceleration)

This code is very barebones and I would argue is not actually that useful. However, I made it so I might as well upload it, right? 

I solved all of the SUVAT equations either in my head or on paper and used these to create this program. If you do not know what the SUVAT equations are, then basically they are equations describing the motion of an object with the following variables:

s (or sometimes x) = distance travelled
u = initial velocity
v = final velocity
a = acceleration (this must be constant)
t = time

You have to be gentle with this program as it has minimal fool-proofing. Give it the numbers it wants and don't give it any funny strings.
